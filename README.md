# Mosaic

Mosaic is a small compiled language built using [QBE](https://c9x.me/compile).

## Documentation
Documentation can be found in the [docs](docs/src) directory
or at [the Mosaic website](https://msc.ljpprojects.org/docs/).

## Why?
I wanted to experiment with creating a compiled language.
The choice of backend — QBE — was random.

## Supported Targets (tested)
* `aarch64-apple-darwin`
* `x86_64-apple-darwin`

## Planned targets
* `WASM`
