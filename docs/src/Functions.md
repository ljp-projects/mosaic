In Mosaic — similar to many other languages — functions are declared using the `fn` keyword. Like Rust, a colon separates the parameter's name from the parameter's type, and an arrow (`->`) separates the main function declaration from the return type and body. Like Swift, function modifiers (i.e. `export`) come before the arrow.

```swift
fn main() export -> i32 {
	return 0
}
```
