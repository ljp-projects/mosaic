To install mosaic, just run these 2 commands:

```
cargo install mosaic-lang
msc finish
```

The first one installs the `msc` binary, and the second adds the `core` and `std` libraries to `~/.msc/mods`.

Make sure to install all of Mosaic's prerequisites.

To test if the installation worked, run `msc --version`.
## Installing on Windows
