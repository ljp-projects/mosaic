Zero-sized types
In Mosaic, there is one zero-sized type (ZST), null, which is equivalent to C&rsquo;s void type.
Unsized types
In Mosaic, all types have a size known at compile time, so any unsized types (UTs) must always be behind some kind of indirection (see [[Indirection]].)

There is 1 zero-sized type, <code>null</code>, which is like <code>void</code> in other languages. To create a null pointer, see [[Pointers]].</p>
<h2 id="zero-sized-types">Zero-sized types</h2>
<p>In Mosaic, there is one zero-sized type (ZST), <code>null</code>, which is equivalent to C&rsquo;s <code>void</code> type.</p>
<h2 id="unsized-types">Unsized types</h2>
<p>In Mosaic, all types have a size known at compile time, so any unsized types (UTs) must always be behind some kind of indirection (see [[Indirection]].) One UT is the <code>any</code> type, which is most commonly used as <code>*any</code>, which allows any Mosaic pointer, after a cast (see [[Casts]].) At the moment, you cannot declare custom UTs.</p>
<p>This is a list of Mosaic&rsquo;s UTs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>any</code></li>
<li><code>[T]</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scalar-types">Scalar Types</h2>
<p>In Mosaic, most of the core types are scalar, and hold just one value. These include integer types (see [[Integers]]), floating point types (see [[Floats]]) and all pointers (see [[Pointers]]).</p>
<h3 id="integers">Integers</h3>
<p>In Mosaic, these are the integer types:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Size</th>
          <th>Signed type</th>
          <th>Unsigned type</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>8-bit</td>
          <td><code>i8</code></td>
          <td><code>u8</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>16-bit</td>
          <td><code>i16</code></td>
          <td><code>u16</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>32-bit</td>
          <td><code>i32</code></td>
          <td><code>u32</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>64-bit</td>
          <td><code>i64</code></td>
          <td><code>u64</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>arch</td>
          <td><code>iarch</code></td>
          <td><code>uarch</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>If a type is unsigned, is simply means that it cannot be negative. This allows for a higher maximum value. Unsigned types can store values within these limits, assuming <code>n</code> is the size (in bits) of the integer type.</td>
          <td></td>
          <td></td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>$$max=2^n-1$$
$$min=0$$</p>
<p>Signed types can store any value within these limits.</p>
<p>$$max = 2^{n-1} - 1$$
$$min=-(2^{n-1})$$</p>
<p>This means that <code>i8</code> (which is equivalent to C&rsquo;s <code>char</code>) can store values from 127 to -128. <code>u8</code> can store values from 0 to 255.</p>
<p>The <code>iarch</code> and <code>uarch</code> types represent the integer type that has the same size as pointers on the target device. This means that the size of all pointers are equal to the size of <code>isize</code> and <code>usize</code>. For example, if your target is a 32-bit device, then the size of pointers is 32 bits, so the size of <code>iarch</code> and <code>uarch</code> is also 32 bits.</p>
<p>All integer literals have the type <code>i32</code>.</p>
<h3 id="floats">Floats</h3>
<p>In Mosaic, there are 2 types of floats:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Size</th>
          <th>Type</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>32-bits</td>
          <td><code>f32</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>64-bits</td>
          <td><code>f64</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>These floating point types are always signed. See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754#Basic_and_interchange_formats">IEEE 754 standard</a> for more info.</td>
          <td></td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>All floating point literals have the type <code>f64</code>.</p>
<h3 id="pointers">Pointers</h3>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This section expects that you know what a pointer is and how they work.</p>
<p>In Mosaic, there are 5 kinds of pointers. This is a lot, until you realise Rust has 4 (<code>*const</code>, <code>*mut</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&amp;mut</code>). In Mosaic, however, the different types of pointers do not represent mutability, but instead the type of data it points to and how to interpret that data.</p>

          <th>Description</th>

      <tr>
          <td><code>*T</code></td>
          <td>A regular pointer to <code>T</code></td>
          <td><code>*mut T</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><code>*[T]</code></td>
          <td>A pointer to <code>T</code> with runtime length</td>
          <td>N/A (closest to <code>*mut [T]</code>)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><code>*N[T]</code></td>
          <td>A pointer to <code>T</code> with compile-time length</td>
          <td><code>*mut [T; N]</code> + compile-time info</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><code>*:0[i8]</code></td>
          <td>A C string (of signed characters)</td>
          <td><code>*mut i8</code> + null-termination</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td><code>*:0[u8]</code></td>
          <td>A C string (of unsigned characters)</td>

      <tr>
          <td>The most unusual one is the fat pointer (the 2nd one), as it has no direct Rust equivalent. it is a normal pointer in every way except that the first 4 bytes that it points to are always reserved to store the length.</td>
