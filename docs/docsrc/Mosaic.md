Mosaic is a small programming language syntactically inspired by Swift and Rust. It is built using cranelift, and is compiled AOT. For now, it only works on POSIX systems.

## Prerequisites
Mosaic needs Shell and `gcc` to function properly, unless specified otherwise (see [[Build Flags]]). To install mosaic, you need to have Rust installed.

## Who is Mosaic For?
Mosaic is for people who want more of a challenge than C. Like C, memory is primarily managed manually, but unlike C, there are no structs (see [[Type Extensions]]). Mosaic is not for the faint of heart.
